# Love Block Project

Marriage is an outdated institution....but not any more!!!
Do you want to get chained today?

I do.

## How to use
First install:
Node.js
Metamask (https://metamask.io/)

Once testrpc is installed, it should be run in a separate terminal window. It will print out 10 pre-funded accounts with a 12 word mnemonic that will allow you to regenerate these.

```
git clone https://github.com/adoolaeghe/Love-Block
cd Love-Block
npm install -g ethereumjs-testrpc
npm install -g truffle
testrpc # in a separate terminal window
testrpc -m "testrpc mneumonic"
truffle migrate
...
```

To run the tests:
```
truffle test
```
